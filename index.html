<h1>Assignment 1</h1>




<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>My name is Jacob King, student number s3858820. My email is 
JacobKing64@Outlook.com. I am an Australian citizen but the rest of my family was 
born in Hungary. Inside the household is somewhat more European, in terms of culture,  
than the typical Australian&lsquo;s, but I only speak English. After completing high
 school I  went to Curtin for their Engineering and Science enabling course and then 
 did four units in the Engineering foundation year. Only in this semester have I 
  enrolled in RMIT, and I&lsquo;m going for a bachelor of I.T. and thinking to major in 
  software engineering. The main hobbies I have at the moment are table-top gaming,
  mostly 5th Edition D & D, as well as PC gaming.</p>

  

<h2>Interests in IT</h2>

<p>In my time at Curtin University I have completed three units revolving around I.T.
 Of these, two were programming orientated and the third was on databases. I learnt the
 basics of the language C. These units were my first exposure to anything relevant to 
 the I.T. industry. Before this, I played PC games, but I had not had any experience
 with coding or the backend of software. I immediately started enjoyed these units far
 more than the others I was enrolled it, so I decided I wanted to major in Software 
 Development instead of Communication Systems Engineering. This might change however, 
 as I get more experience with the field of I.T. and find a passion for a specific 
 field in I.T.</p>
 
 
 
 <h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
 
 <p>I chose to come to RMIT for a course change originally. I was with Curtin, but
 decided to change the degree I was doing and the best way for me to do this was 
 through RMIT. The date for course change had gone by for Curtin and RMIT was one 
 of some universities still open for applications. Out of these other universities
 I chose RMIT because of the future job prospects. RMITs connection to the industry 
 and the engagement RMIT has the industry&lsquo;s needs were a key factor in this decision.
 In a developing field such as IT, connection to the industry&lsquo;s needs is essential.
 I also read up on past students experiences with RMIT, and the major take away
 from it was that RMIT is more hands on than other universities and gives more 
 opportunity for networking. In my time at Curtin, I had discovered the importance 
 of knowing people in the industry you wish to be part of. This allows you to make 
 connections, making it somewhat easier to find a job once the degree is complete.
 
 
 
 <h2>What I Expect to Learn</h2>
 
 <p> By the end of my time with RMIT I expect to have learnt how to program and develop 
software in a professional setting using different development methodologies. I 
expect this to involve different programming languages, how to use APIs, databasing,
 how to wright manuals, teamworking skills, networking, program designing and 
 architecture, how hardware functions and how to communicate effectively. I also
 expect to know how to apply these skills in a professional setting. </p>

 
 <h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
 
 <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/40997065?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=b8c6f095-d6e1-446c-8527-99216c2c91b6">This is the link to the job.</a>
<img src="Job1.jpg">
 
 
 <h3>Why the Position is Appealing</h3>
 
<p>The job is developing software for real world application, most likely for ports,
 mining and emergency services. This software being developed could be embedded 
 software, web based or for Windows. To me, the two most important requirements 
 of this position are communication skills and the ability to analyse and solve 
 complex problems. I found this position appealing because of the critical thinking 
 aspect – needing to solve complex problems. When I first started to learn how to 
 code, I enjoyed the challenge of solving the problem at hand. Critical thinking was
 by far the most engaging aspect. Secondly, was thinking about the applications 
 software had in the real-world. Before I learnt the basics of coding, I did not
 realise software had near unlimited potential if applied and developed properly.
 That is what I want to do for a job. Something that keeps me engaged and thinking
 with real world applications. </p>
 
 

<h3>Skill, Qualifications and Experience Required for the Position</h3>

<p>The position requires a good working attitude, as with most things in life. 
Someone willing to work at the job. Omnitronics requires the applicant to have a 
degree in software engineering, or a similar degree. On top of this degree the 
applicant is also expected to have at minimum of four years in software engineering,
 as a job. Specifically, they require someone who is experienced in all the stages 
 of developing software from concept to implementation. The language Omnitronics 
 requires for this position is C#. This position will revolve around teamwork, 
 so communication is an essential skill for the job. Not only communicating with 
 the team but on all levels of understanding, customer included.</p>
 
 
 
 <h3>Skills, Qualifications and Experience I Currently Have</h3>
 
 <p>I have fundamental knowledge of C, visual basic and MS access. I have completed
 two units in programming one on C and the other on Visual Basic. I have also
 completed a unit on databasing. All of these units were with Curtin university.
 I also have good communication skills, having completed Engineering Foundations 
 and Design Principles as well as Engineering Foundations Principles and 
 Communications. Both of these units were purely team-oriented design units, 
 focusing on team communication and collaborative efforts to complete and prototype 
 a project. </p>
 
 
 <h3>How I Plan to Get the Skills, Qualificationsand Experience Required</h3>
 
 <p>The first skill to obtain is knowledge of C#, like any other programming 
 language that will take practice and familiarity. Writing software in C# is 
 the best way to understand the syntax, and dissecting open source projects is 
 another way to gain understanding of limitations of the language. The qualification 
 of &ldquo;Tertiary Degree in Software Engineering&rdquo; I plan on getting through RMIT, hence 
 why I am doing this course. The four years requirement of work experience can be 
 gained though other development jobs. Jobs that are less complicated will be an 
 excellent start, especially to gain knowledge of how industry operates, possibly
 an internship to start with. The ability to solve problems and analyse them is
 required to do any coding what so ever. The more projects someone works on, the 
 better this skill will become. This is what I plan to do, practice and gain work 
 experience. I have a fundamental knowledge of how to compartmentalise aspects of 
 a project in a small team environment. As with all things this can be improved on, 
 and the best way to that is experience. Time management is my most lacking skill
 and one of the most important ones. I plan to improve this by trying keep to a 
 schedule for university and is currently something I am working on.</p>
 
 
 
 <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
 
 <h3> Myers-Briggs Test </h3>
 <p> <img src="INTP1.jpg"> </p>
 <p>According to the Myers-Briggs personality test on <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16Personalities</a> 
 I am an INTP, or Logician personality type. INTPs tend to be quiet and blunt, generally
 considered to be the most logically precise of the personality types. Patterns 
 and logic are appreciated by the INTP type. When speaking to others INTPs share
 thoughts that are unfinished, so can come off as unreliable. This is not the case,
 as the INTP personality type is the most willing and excited to work through a
 problem, finding the best solution. Once an INTP has an environment that allows it,
 they will keep working towards the solution – because they enjoy it.  </p>
 
 
 
 <h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
 <p>  <img src="LearningStyle.jpg"> </p>
 <p> On education planer, I am a Visual/Tactile learner. This means that I need to 
 see how things work and I will need to take them apart and reassemble them. For me 
 to get a good idea on how something works I will need to dissect and reassemble 
 the whole thing, and watch the function unfold. Another way to learn well is by 
 visualisation. To imagine the parts working together. In software visual would be 
 on the flowchart level of design and tactile is the function structure. Tactile 
 would involve manipulation the function and seeing what would happen. Visual would 
 be manipulating the flowchart.   </p>
 
 
 <h3>Creativity Test</h3>
 <p>   <img src="CreativityTest.jpg"></p>
 <p>The third test was a creativity test on <a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/">TestMyCreativity</a> 
 According to this test my Complexity and Paradox scores were above average, and
 my Connection score was below average. The others were close to average. 
 Connection is the ability to connect things that seem unrelated. Paradox is the
 ability to work with and accept information that is contradictory. Complexity is 
 the amount of information that can be manipulated at once. </p>
 
 
 <h3>Team Beahviour</h3>
 
 <p>As an INTP, in a group I will be blunt and straight forward with any queries 
 or issues that arise. I will be concise and direct, and this can come off as rude
 in some situations, meaning I will need to try to be more tactile in my language.
 Compared to the rest of the team, I will most likely be the last to make connections
 between things that don&lsquo;t already have them. If I do not understand something 
 already, I will need to ask for clarification. Once I understand the connection
 between parts of the project then I will most likely do well working on my part. 
 When there is an inevitable interpersonal conflict, I will tend to look for a 
 logical solution rather than support the people in question. If emotions run too
 high, then I will be less capable of diffusing the situation.</p>
 
 
 <h3> Forming a Team</h3>
 <p> When needing clarification on something, it would be best to have someone in 
 the team that can show rather than tell. The less words the better, so someone
 concise and direct with language would be an ideal choice. Another thing that 
 should be considered is how direct I can be with someone in the team. Since the
 INTP personality enjoys problem solving, I will need to consider avoiding people
 who do not. This is so that the work can be even distributed. When conflict occurs
 between people, I will not be the best choice to diffuse it, so either someone with 
 better personal skills than I is needed or the problem will be shunted to the 
 higher-ups. </p>

 <h2>Project Idea</h2>
 <h3>Overview</h3>
 <p>The project is an Australia rail manager. It will be software that arranges
 freight cars hauled by rail for greatest efficiency in chosen variables. 
 The software, given all the information in a system of transportation, can 
 choose to optimise the hauling for either time taken, fuel efficiency both at 
 cheapest cost. If a company needs to move mail or express freight then time is 
 optimised for. Where as a ore hauling train will be optimised to fuel efficiency. 
 The software will also choose the optimal engines to move the type of cargo, given 
 the variable chosen to be optimised. The software will take into account loading 
 and unloading times as well as wagon arrangement, engine statistics and freight 
 weight.</p>
 
 <h3> Motivation </h3>
 <p>he transportation industry is essential to make the world function, without it, 
 nothing could get done. With increased efficiency in the transportation, the price
 of shipping decreases allowing for greater spending on other things. Over 413 
 billion tonnes/km of freight was shipped over rail in 2015 – 2016. Increasing 
 the efficiency of the rail network in Australia will save on the cost of fueling. 
 This project will be interesting because of the potential to expand the scope to
 beyond rail in the future. It could be applied to trucks and even mining vehicles.
 </p>
 
 <h3> Description </h3>
<p> A database will have all the statistics of engines on a specific rail network. 
These engines service several stations. The software will manage the engines and 
wagons to create the most cost-effective solution to the transportation needs on 
that rail network. Needs of the rail network could include high priority mail,
 requiring maximum speed or could be ore hauling at greatest fuel efficiency. 
 Depending on what the freight is, the software will determine the most 
 cost-effective solution with the assets in the rail network. In future this 
 project could be expanded to controlling the trains automatically.</p>

<p>If a rail network has several engines and wagons in it, the software will
 automatically generate the most cost-effective solution with these assets.
 However, this will only be possible if the rail network has several kinds of 
 engines. Existing engines will require new communication infrastructure with 
 the controlling software. In addition, multiple rail networks can be linked
 together to form a larger network, increasing overall efficiency of rail
 transportation. Controlling computers will also need to be set up in this 
 infrastructure. </p>

<p>The controlling software will calculate the best possible combination of engines
 and wagons for a specific task. This task could be speed or efficiency dependant,
 in either case the software would prioritise the requirement. There will be options 
 in the software to alter the desired cost vs time. If a delivery would take the 
 shortest time, that does not necessarily mean the most efficient regarding cost.
 If there is a time limit that the hauling needs to be completed by, then the
 software will prioritise this, at minimum cost.</p>

<p>Distances between stations, be it cargo or refuelling, will operate on a node
 system. Nodes will reduce the strain on processing power compared to full rail
 network calculations. Previously found optimal solutions can be saved in the
 software’s database to further reduce processing needs. This node system can 
 allow for best distance pathfinding, while keeping other train’s routs in mind. 
 As trains pass though nodes, the software adjusts the path the train can take.
 This will be easy to implement with already existing rail infrastructure. Rail
 networks operate on blocks, a segment of track that is long enough for a train 
 to stop in, where no other train may enter. Each block will become a node in the
 software. </p>

<p>With some adjustments to the current scope of the project, the software will 
also be able to find the most economically viable routs for passengers. Using 
previous routs and averaging their profitability, the software can also find 
the most profitable cargo. Companies can focus on these routs to maximize their 
profits. If there is a line that requires more engines and wagons, the software 
can inform the company. This allows for informed decision making by the company 
to further expand their catalogue.</p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>Software required to accomplish this project is not too complicated,
 if not time consuming to code. Once this base logic module is written, 
 then networking is the next complicated step. However, this is just getting
 can do what it is supposed to do. To ensure the trains and command/logic module 
 are communicating, there will need to be infrastructure to facilitate it. This
 could be satellite or radio, depending on which is most cost effective for the
 given region of track.</p>
 
 <h3>Skills Required</h3>
 <p>There will need to be programming knowledge - though I am unsure of the best 
 language to use for this application. Databasing and networking skills are a must.
 No specialised hardware is required, and the hardware of the system is pre-existing
 trains and wagons. This is an extension to pre-existing infrastructure. The skills
 to program an application such as this should be easy to find, so long as the person
 programming has fundamental knowledge of coding. Databasing is an easy skill to 
 find or acquire. Networking is not an uncommon skill in the IT field, so overall
 the skills and knowledge needed for this application are very feasible. The hardest 
 part of this project will be getting rail companies to adopt the software. </p>
 
 <h3>Outcome</h3>
 <p>If this project is successful then rail companies will have access to 
 real-time rail optimisation and management tools. Once this software is 
 completed, they also have the best engine dispatching solutions available.
 Companies will also have easy access to their catalogue of engines, wagons, 
 their locations and current deployment. All of this will update in real time
 with minimal human interaction. Rail companies will require less people working
 on switchboards to manage routs, saving money on salaries and the transportation 
 of freight. </p>
